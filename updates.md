OpenANC has been updated with the results of the Nov 5, 2024 election. According to DCBOE, there were 291 people who won election who had been listed on the ballot and 26 people who won election as write-in candidates, making a total of 317 new commissioners to start the 2025-2027 term. 

Behind the scenes, I have improved the matching process. This should allow me to add results from older ANC elections. Also, this Updates page is new!

I created a new [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/openanc.org) page for OpenANC. I have decided to stop posting on X. I will continue to post updates on [Mastodon](https://dmv.community/@openanc). 

As always, if you see any issues with the data, please email me: "hi at openanc dot org"
