<h1>About OpenANC</h1>

<p>OpenANC is an open database of Washington, DC Advisory Neighborhood Commission districts, commissioners, and candidates.</p>

<p>OpenANC is a non-official, non-commercial, non-partisan public resource. It was created to provide voters and candidates with more information about ANC districts with the goal of lowering the barriers to participation in local government. </p>

<h2>What's an ANC?</h2>


<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<p>The list of current commissioners comes from the DC Office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions: <a href="https://anc.dc.gov/">https://anc.dc.gov/</a></p>

<p>The list of candidates comes from a list published by the DC Board of Elections: <a href="https://www.dcboe.org/Candidates/2020-Candidates">https://www.dcboe.org/Candidates/2020-Candidates</a></p>

<p>The list of candidates is updated approximately every weekday and updates will be reflected on OpenANC. </p>

<h2>For Candidates</h2>

<p>OpenANC will list your candidacy if you publicly declare it (in an ANC meeting, on Twitter, or in any other public forum), even if your name hasn't shown up on the list of candidates published by the Board of Elections. Please submit your information and you will be included in OpenANC. </p>
