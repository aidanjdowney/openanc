pdf_errors_to_check.txt

These should all be fixed in candidates_dcboe.csv:

No longer an issue:
* Benjamin Hart Butz is listed as running in 1C07 but his address (2480 16th Street, NW) puts him in 1C06

* 7C02,Patricia Williams has pickup date of "6/302020"
* 7F06,Carol E. Fletcher has filed date of "7F06"
* 1C08,"Fiona Clem" has 2 spaces in the name, sometimes duplicated
* Lisa Palmer is duplicated by DCBOE. She IS NOT running in 2B03. She IS running in 2E05

Was a problem with Tabula:
* Email cells merged: 
    * John Feeley (5B05) - Gail Brevard (5C01)
    * Kevin B. Coleman (8B04) - Darrell Gaston (8B04)
* Address cells merged: 
    * 8E06,Karlene Armstead - 8E06,Brittany Geneva Cummings



Unknown: 
* Are Regina Pixley and Reginia R. Summers different people? Both are listed in 8C04 with different addresses and phone numbers. Currently treating them as different.
