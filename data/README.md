## Table Descriptions

### commissioners

One row per commissioner. 

If a commissioner has served in two districts (defined as having two different `smd_id`), then there will be two rows for that commissioner. 

If there were breaks in time in a commissioner's service, those breaks are represented as multiple rows. For instance, if a commissioner served, took a break, then served again, that would be two rows for that commissioner.
