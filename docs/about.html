<h1>About OpenANC</h1>

<p>OpenANC is an open database of Washington, DC Advisory Neighborhood Commission districts, commissioners, and candidates.</p>

<p>OpenANC is a non-official, non-commercial, non-partisan public resource. It was created to provide voters and candidates with more information about ANC districts with the goal of lowering the barriers to participation in local government. </p>

<h2>What's an ANC?</h2>

<p>Advisory Neighborhood Commissions are local government organizations in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Neighborhood_Commission">Wikipedia</a>: "ANCs consider a wide range of policies and programs affecting their neighborhoods, including traffic, parking, recreation, street improvements, liquor licenses, zoning, economic development, police protection, sanitation and trash collection, and the District's annual budget. Commissioners serve two-year terms and receive no salary, but commissions do receive funds for the general purpose of improving their area and hiring staff.</p>

<p>DC has 40 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions. Each commission consists of 2 to 12 commissioners who represent single member districts (SMDs). Each SMD contains about 2,000 residents. There are 296 total SMDs in DC</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<p>The list of current commissioners comes from the DC Office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions: <a href="https://anc.dc.gov/">https://anc.dc.gov/</a></p>

<p>The list of candidates comes from a list published by the DC Board of Elections: <a href="https://www.dcboe.org/Candidates/2020-Candidates">https://www.dcboe.org/Candidates/2020-Candidates</a></p>

<p>The district shapefiles come from Open Data DC: <a href="https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/single-member-district-from-2013">https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/single-member-district-from-2013</a></p>

<p>The names of ANCs were sourced from a database built by David Edmondson, Editor, <a href="http://www.thegreatermarin.org/">The Greater Marin</a>.</p>

<p>The raw data behind OpenANC is available on Google Sheets: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XoT92wFBKdmnUc6AXwABeWNjsjcwrGMPMKu1XsBOygU/edit?usp=sharing">OpenANC Published</a></p>

<h2>Want to run for ANC?</h2>

<p>Great idea! The deadline for qualifying for the ballot has passed, but you can still run as a write-in candidate. It's not unusual for a write-in candidate to win an ANC election. The Office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions has more information on running for ANC as a write-in candidate: <a href="https://anc.dc.gov/page/running-write-candidate">https://anc.dc.gov/page/running-write-candidate</a></p>
